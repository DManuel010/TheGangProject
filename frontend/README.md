# TheGangProject FrontEnd

![CI](https://github.com/DManuel010/TheGangProject/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Pre-requirements

- NodeJS >v12.14.1: NodeJS Engine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Yarn package manager: NodeJS has a default built-in package manager (npm) but it is slow when installing dependencies. this is better alternative. You can download it [here](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (Make sure using legacy version for now)
- Visual Studio Code: Honestly you can use any text editor but I personally find this has a lot of plugins if you working on multi language projects. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## How did this generate?

I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is a boilerplate for React Web App. What it does well is it takes out the WebPack bundling layer (the layer that translates NodeJS code into something the web browser can understand) so you can just worry about building the UI.

If you want to generate your own webapp, after you installed all pre-req, just run (from a different directory)

```
npx create-react-app <name-of-the-app-you-want-to create>
```

it will generate a boilerplate exactly like this

## Structure

There are some files/folder that you will see and might be overwhelmed. This section is to help you understand what each of them do.

# NodeJS

- `package.json`: This is a manifest of the project. in here you will find all the dependencies, running scripts, as well as other information related to the project
- `yarn.lock`: this is an autogenerated file and might get updated from time to time. what it will do, is caching all your dependencies version to ensure that if you run the project on another machine, it would still operate normally
- `node_modules/`: you will not see this before installing dependencies. You would never check this in git because the size of this is really big. This stores all the dependencies of your project.

# React

- `public/`: this holds the entry point of the production version of the webapp. The stuff in there are the stuff that does not need to be bundled and tie in more with the metadata of the webapp rather than the content
- `src/`: This is where you would spend most of your time on. It hold all the code and logic for the UI. This is a structure I generally use to make sure everything is modular and clear

```
src/
    __tests__/          # testing scripts go here
    assets/             # static resources (data, images that will never get updated)
    components/         # storing reusable components in web app (think buttons, table, etc)
    containers/         # storing each "pages" in web app (think HomePage, ErrorPage)
    layout/             # a group of components that get reuse on multiple pages
    context/            # storing things that you want every components, containers can access
    routes.js           #just a list storing all the routes of the web app (can be nested)
    app.js
    app.css             #styling for app
    index.js            #entry point of the webapp, basically just call app.js
    serviceWorker.js    #AUTOGENERATED
    setupTests.js       #AUTOGENERATED, to run test
```

# Others

- `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint file. this is a configuration for a tool use to yell at you if you write bad code. if you use VSCode, get `ESLint` plugin
- `.prettierrc.js`: Prettier file. this is a configuration for a tool that help format code automatically just so we can generalize the code and make it look nice. If you use VSCode, get `Prettier` plugin
- `.<something>ignore`: this is to tell tools to ignore these file and not inspect them.

## Development

You need Powershell or Terminal to do this.
If you use VisualStudio code, go to the menu tab at the top and choose

```
Terminal > new terminal (shortcut is `ctrl + alt + ~`)
```

To run this webapp, first of all you need to install all dependencies. From the root of the repo:

```
cd frontend/
yarn
```

Then simply run

```
yarn start
```

What this does is it will spin up a **dev** server for you. The cool thing is if you change the code in `src/`, it will automatically reflect as long as the **dev** server running (i.e you didn't close the shell or exit out of the process (using `ctrl + c`))

after a few seconds you should see `Compiled Successfully`. Then you can go to open your favorite browser and type

```
http://localhost:3000
```

and voila!

## Deployment

This is to bundle them into something much smaller so you can throw it into a hosting service somewhere

```
yarn build
```

after finish, you will see a build folder. if you throw this build folder on a hosting bucket (s3 for example), you can access it from everywhere! More to this later

## Test

Simply run

```
yarn test
```

It has one default test so obviously we should write more tests!
